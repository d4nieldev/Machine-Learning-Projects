# Machine-Learning-Projects
A repository with machine learning projects from Pierian Data's udemy course that I've done by myself.

## My projects:
### 1. Linear Regression
I just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
<br />
**The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.**

### 2. Logistic Regression
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website.
<br />
We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
